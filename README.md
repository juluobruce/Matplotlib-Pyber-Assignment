# Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots

## Background (Pyber)

![Ride](Images/Ride.png)

Using Pandas & Matplot to analyze this CSV file. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.


* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

 Three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

# Formats:

* Used Pandas Library, Matplotlib library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* Proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, X and Y Axis Limits, etc.

# Observations: 

•	There is a correlation between the number of rides and the average fare. Based on the scatter bubble plot, urban cities have the lowest average fare while at the same time, it has the highest number of rides (With Pyber of 62.7 %). This illustrates the surplus amount of competition within the urban drivers compare to rural and suburban areas. Thus, even with lower fares – drivers will always have customers needing rides no matter what. Moreover, the graph shows that despite the high demand of rides in the city, there aren’t enough drivers of Pyber to meet these demands. It’s recommended that Pyber optimize the amount of urban drivers to meet the demands as much as possible. However, the benefit of having high demand is that there will be an increase of sales revenue for Pyber and customers will not be turning to Pyber’s other competitors such as other taxi or ride sharing services. Another is observation is that Pyber’s secondary resource of revenue is coming from suburban areas. Since the rates are higher compare to the urban city, Pyber should increase the amount of drivers in suburban areas as well.
